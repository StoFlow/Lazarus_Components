This component provides a combobox that displays the available Fonts.
It has been tested with Win11 and Linux Mint22

Attention :
-----------
With Linux I experienced issues with all types of comboboxes.
If the number of items is (too) high, 
then the bounds of the displayed list may be wrong.
The count of displayed items may exceed value entered in DropDownCount.

With Linux I still use GTK2 and have no experiences with other widget sets yet.
So the result with other WS might be catastrophically.
